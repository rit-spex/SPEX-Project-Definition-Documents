\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{H}{igh} Altitude Balloons (HABs) are autonomous balloons sent up to 100,000 feet and serve as research platforms for a variety of purposes. 
SPEX has designed, constructed and launched a number of HABs, with HAB4 being the latest iteration. 
A HAB will usually fly with, at the very least, a power system, one-way communication notifying a ground station of its position and basic electronics. 
For this purpose a HAB must have a safe and reliable structure capable of providing protection from different atmospheric conditions, including temperature and pressure. 
It is also preferred if this structure allows for modular payload development and is compatible with cubesat designs. 
Constraints of mass and volume follow naturally, leading to limitations then on power, processing and memory capabilities and communication rate and range. 
Essential HAB functions such as position tracking and power delivery should be as weight and volume efficient as possible to optimize payload volume and mass budgets.

Image processing is the application of computer algorithms or digital processing techniques to images. 
Recent advances have made it possible to carry out image processing on relatively cheap, light and easily interfaceable consumer electronic equipment. 
Computer Vision (CV) is the automated extraction of information from one or several images. 
CV allows for autonomous extraction and interpretation of information from an image feed and can be utilized for a variety of applications. 
Among these are the identification of objects or the detection of a horizon. 
Many of the algorithms can be trained to recognize particular features or objects, or a combination thereof, to recognize, predict or quantify another feature or quantity.

This Project Definition Document describes a High Altitude Balloon suited to flying imaging and CV payloads as discussed in the ``On-Board Image Processing and Computer Vision Techniques on Low-Cost Consumer Electronics for Vegetation Density Mapping and Other Experiments'' Project Definition Document~\cite{habcvpdd}. 
These payloads are designed to be achievable using readily available consumer electronics within a reasonable development budget. 

\section{Primary Objective}
\label{primaryobjectives}
\subsection{Vehicle}
\label{vehicleobjectives}
Development of a reliable HAB vehicle capable of flying modular payloads, as described in (\autoref{implementation}), is a primary objective. 

\subsection{Payload}
\label{payloadobjectives}
The primary payload, \textit{Plant Life Automatic NDVI with Telemetry from a High Altitude Balloon} (PLANTHAB) is a continuation of \textit{Where U At Plants?} (WUAP), a payload that flew on the SPEX high altitude balloon  HAB4 in Spring of 2018~\cite{wuaphab4}. 
PLANTHAB shares its predecessor's primary objectives to measure vegetation density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with visible to near-infrared (VNIR) imaging, demonstrate on-board image processing, and gather large datasets of aerial images using low cost, entry-level electronics. 
NDVI data collected in flight will be validated using NASA NDVI or Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) datasets.

WUAP demonstrated the core concepts of image processing and imaging payloads on high altitude balloon missions but did not meet all of its objectives or design goals and encountered unexpected problems in flight~\cite[Post-Flight Analysis]{wuaphab4}. 
Though PLANTHAB will attempt the same mission as WUAP as a follow-on payload, it will place more emphasis and effort on testing, reliability, and system architecture. 
The priorities for PLANTHAB development are as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}\small
    \item \textbf{Understanding the system.} There should be no surprises in flight, and if goals or target performanceare not met it should be known by how much.
    \item \textbf{Reliability and stability.} The system should behave the same way every time, and should produce the same output for a given (known) set of inputs.
    \item \textbf{Performance.} The quality of output data should reach the maximum possible for the system's capability. Realize all the potential of the system.
\end{enumerate}

A list of ``essential questions'' to be addressed during PLANTHAB's development is given in appendix \ref{essentialquestions}.


\section{Secondary Objectives}
\label{secondaryobjectives}
A two-way communication system is desired but may be scaled back due to resource limitations based on the choice of payload. 
Similarly, consistent location information has been an elusive target. 
As the HAB is trusted with more complex payloads, the tracking becomes of greater importance.
 
In addition to NDVI studies of vegetation density in the VNIR band, PLANTHAB aims to demonstrate CV techniques such as object detection and image segmentation of populated areas. 
On the ground, methods of determining and mapping vegetation density from RGB visible images alone will be developed using computer vision and machine learning techniques with public NDVI data and aerial photography, and then applied to PLANTHAB datasets. 

\section{Benefit to SPEX}
\label{benefittospex}
The high altitude balloon system offers a unique environment to develop skills and demonstrate prowess to RIT faculty and staff, potential SPEX members, and potential sponsors.
A HAB bearing the mark of RIT SPEX is a declaration that we can confidently launch non-trivial payloads in a system of our making.
HAB demands careful planning, intelligent utilization of resources, considerable multidisciplinary engineering and long-term teamwork. 
A successful HAB is thus linked to a success-ready SPEX, whose members are now better prepared for any task. 
HAB also serves as a unique testing platform for projects involving different temperatures, altitudes or pressures than those experienced normally. 
This is particularly useful for lower-altitude rocket payloads, testing them for a fraction of the cost or risk. 
HABs designed with a payload form resembling a cubesat or combination thereof have an even wider utilization. 
HABs are also the easiest platform for testing of longer-range communication systems.

The pursuit of HAB is the pursuit of maximizing scientific output using off-the-shelf components and present limitations of SPEX's human capital. 
Progress here develops SPEX's knowledge base for all future missions, including SPEX's understanding of what can and cannot be achieved. 
Presently proposed operations include rigorous pre-flight testing for diagnosis and correction of software and hardware components, post-flight analysis and amelioration and inculcation of this into the design cycle. 

Another aspect to SPEX is the learning in the process, with documentation specified as a deliverable. 
Also, by incorporating testing and training processes into the design and execution process, SPEX can iterate on more advanced software tools. 
Specific focus on algorithmic improvisation may also draw in more talent, which in turn advances the scope of possible missions.

As image processing tools advance, ever more useful information can be garnered from the same physical equipment. 
Progress here automatically increases SPEX's potential to make news, capture imaginations and talent, and grow.  
This advantage is both due to us maximizing the knowledge gleaned from cheap and readily available hardware, as well as the abundance of open source resources for computer vision. 
While the entry requirements are non-zero, the acquisition of talent utilizing OpenCV or useful Python libraries broadens SPEX's options for other ventures, such as IREC's SDL Payload Challenge. 

Developing the capability to perform Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides a foundation for a wide range of future imaging payloads. 
SPEX is yet to use near-Infrared imaging, and this analysis for NDVI serves as a new but relatively simple processing exercise.

Further, this project offers great flexibility in terms of team composition, once beyond a requisite minimum.
While the mechanical design of the HAB is quite mature, its electrical systems are not.
An gifted electronics team may choose to consider much more advanced imaging equipment or image processing using other factors to control, requiring only a moderate CS investment. 
Similarly, the potential for much more advanced algorithmic excursions on maintained or minimally modified hardware is substantial. 

As RIT looks to expand its research endeavors, especially in fields such as Imaging Science where it possesses an advantage, developing a long and mutually beneficial relationship with that department is also a goal unto itself. 
As a platform for experiments, SPEX has the unique opportunity to be a student body involved in the synthesis, publication and presentation of materials. 
This can build SPEX's reputation and foster relationships with faculty and research organizations, leading to opportunities for mentorship and funding from sustainable sources.

\section{Implementation}
\label{implementation}
\subsection{Deliverables}
\label{deliverables}
\subsubsection{Documentation}
\label{deliverables-documentation}
 HAB5 will require GitHub repositories for all software that is developed. Library dependencies will be listed with references or citations to existing codebases. Duplication of online resources, with citations, will be made to aid in reproduction of results or retracing of errors.  
 Electronic components utilized will be logged in a bill of materials (BoM) and KiCad files for any custom PCBs will be archived. 
 Printed mechanical parts will have files saved and machined components' sketches will be included. 
 Expectations, hurdles and solutions are to be tabled in documents both before and after the flight.

\subsubsection{Vehicle}
\label{deliverables-vehicle}
The desired product at the end of the development is a modular HAB vehicle capable of reliably, predictably, and safely carrying a payload compatible with a n*cubesat size. 
The vehicle is defined as the mechanically sound HAB structure and common electronic/software components necessary for payload deployment. 
Mechanical soundness includes, but is not limited to, protection from disintegration, temperature, winds, pressure, charge buildup and vibration. 
To this end a power system, APRS transmitter, pressure/temperature/humidity sensor, payload arming/disarming mechanism and all facilitating processing and memory elements. 
There must also be a data analytics system to record flight data and provide information leading to more advanced HABs and missions. 
This must consist of sensors, processing and memory required for the task.
It is expected that the payload will be modular, fitting both an x-u form factor and having a power supply of its own. 
This is because optimization of a HAB vehicle capable of handling any modular payload results in selection for a power system dedicated solely to the HAB vehicle board and merely arming/disarming the payload electronics. 
Past issues have included adhesives melting, batteries breaking apart and damage due to environmental factors. Each of these contingencies is to be specifically tested and solved for.

\subsubsection{Software and Payload}
\label{deliverables-payload}
Python, instead of C/C++ allows for greater accessibility and the tradeoff in moving isn't worth the increased development costs. 
Previous HAB teams have considered this question, and given the resources on the team, their findings are restated. OpenCV 3 will continue to be used as a major part.

The primary payload on HAB5 is the PLANTHAB payload.
Use of NDVI is to be investigated on the ground and considerable attention paid to how NDVI results may be linked to visual spectrum analysis of vegetation. 
While specific to the payload mission selected, exploring the linking of different realms of sensor information is a pursuit which will further aid SPEX. 
An example could be the linking of IMU attitude data to images at the corresponding time, which in turn may allow for correction of apparent areas due to the angle of the camera with respect to the horizon. 
This in turn prepares SPEX for projects requiring this correction be done on-flight, and for other projects such as horizon detection which could ``train'' on-flight by comparing analyzed data to known IMU readings. 
To this end the synchronization of clocks may be pursued. 
Another consistent challenge has been the processing of information on a stream, without information being skipped or resampled. 
Raw and processed information should be saved for later evaluation and iteration of systems.

Detailed test plans and test reports will record the method and results from rigorous testing of mechanical and electrical components, software algorithms, telemetry collection, and fault detection.
Additional and calibrations unique to HAB5 and PLANTHAB include camera alignment; camera stability; spectral response/quantum efficiency; software processing of simulations; payload NDVI/visual functioning while on ground; an electronics functional test with specific focus on power systems and APRS reliability; electronics environmental testing; and integrated system testing.
Time-stamping of information received by different processes may be considered. 
It is also desired that metrics be included for post-flight analysis.

Among the physical requirements for the payload, it is required that the HAB vehicle and payload system be better capable of protecting from environmental factors such as humidity, winds and temperature. Specific to this payload, the alignment of cameras is a question needing further exploration. An angle and separation optimal for the combination of data acquisition and securedness is required. Vibration or displacement during flights can significantly impair or corrupt all information gathered. Fixing this hurdle is critical for future projects which may look to infer distance data with a combination of two cameras or a radar altimeter setup. While the project doesn't expect that these will all be met as results, it is firmly held that the steps taken to implement these goals as best as possible will transformatively improve SPEX's advanced payload capabilities.

\subsection{Milestones}
Development and fabrication milestones are listed in \autoref{milestones-table}.
One key consideration in choosing a time of year to launch HAB5 with PLANTHAB is the abundance of plant life in the area where it will be launched.
In upstate New York, plant vitality is at its highest in late spring through early fall.

\section{Externalities}
\subsection{Prerequisite Skills}
Proficiency in Python (CS 1 or equivalent) is required for implementing PLANTHAB image capturing and processing software. 
Experience with Python computer vision and machine learning tools is required for developing the advanced CV objectives like object detection and segmentation. 
EE skill set varies greatly based on method of implementation---purchasing ready-to-assemble products to design and fabrication of custom PCBs. 
The result is that we have the opportunity to tune implementation based on the EEs we find. 
Understanding of basic circuits and connections/interfacing is still required. 
An understanding of the fundamentals of heat transfer is recommended in order to do basic thermal analysis. 
The HAB structure leverages HAB4 designs so the brunt of mechanical design will focus on camera mounting and enclosures. 
University Physics II (with optics) is recommended for imaging systems testing and calibration tasks.

\subsection{Funding Requirements}
% Payload:  ~$200 (hard cap at $300)
% 2x raspberry pi 3 = $100 @ $40-50 each
% 1x pi camera v2 = $28
% 1x pi camera noir = $25
% An arduino FPGA is a possible but unlikely inclusion, with a price tag of $60. The present budget also leaves room for the physical hardware of the payload including camera mounts and possible printing expenses. A filter setup, a la TetraPi, is deemed to be prohibitively expensive.

% 	1x vis filter (reddish) $100 https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FB650-40 
% 	1x nir filter = $100 https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FB880-70 

This estimate is based off of the inclusion of a prior HAB board for baseline functionality, an existing APRS module and some functional WUAP-I hardware. 
The cost of the balloon and helium are not included. 
Significant leeway was left specifically because the exact implementation topology(for processing) and level of pre-fabrication of components scales inversely with availability of time dedicated by advanced electrical engineering students.

\subsection{Faculty Support}
The project laid forth doesn't assume that faculty support is guaranteed or that any particular faculty members will be forthcoming. 
The project is undertaken in part hoping to build these connections without any significant one-way reliance. 
It is for that reason that specific, informed and meaningful discussions with possible candidates are recommended as the project progresses and substantive results can be shared.

\subsection{Long-term Vision}
As laid out in the \autoref{primaryobjectives} and \autoref{benefittospex}, this document is tabled with an eye to the future. Data collection will focus not just on raw data but also on how processing develops and compares to the knowns. 
Cataloguing the progress, as described in \autoref{deliverables}, builds on present resources and knowledge in a manner amenable to future growth. 
SPEX's in-house ability is developed in line with estimates for skills required for later missions. 

It is also held that missions be pursued on the basis of ability to draw in more permanent and sustainable sources of recognition and funding. 
A divergence from the current model of resetting every year and relying on alumni limits the ability of organization to attempt challenges worthy of its aspirations. 
This PDD explicitly seeks a realization capable of winning eyeballs and sponsors.

In order to accomplish PLANTHAB's goals, students working on the project must find answers to the questions in \autoref{essentialquestions}.
Although some of the concepts are somewhat advanced, all are within reach to motivated undergraduate students provided they have guidance from individuals with experience in the respective fields, such as student or alumni mentors or university faculty members.

\section{Notional Payload Architectures}
\label{architectures}
There are several topologies to address PLANTHAB image capture and processing needs as described in appendix \ref{essentialquestions}.
This appendix suggests notional payload architecture topologies to be considered during development.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{2 SBCs, 1 camera each (like WUAP).} SBCs capture frames based on a master trigger or clock. The SBCs operate completely independently and are not connected.
    \item \textbf{1 SBC controlling 2 cameras.} Two camera modules are commanded from a single SBC, processing is handled by a dedicated SBC that receives images from the upstream SBC.
    \item \textbf{1 SBC, 1+ auxiliary boards.} An SBC handles images and processing but timing and frame captures are controlled by to a specialized FPGA or microcontroller daughter board for each camera. The SBC manages on the high level but processing and timing occurs on the daughter boards.
    \item \textbf{2+ SBCs for each of 2 cameras.} Timing and capturing is handled by any of the topologies above. The processing workload is parallelized between multiple SBCs for each image stream so that processing signal chains can keep up with image capture rates.
\end{enumerate}

The architecture selected for the PLANTHAB payload must balance cost, performance, complexity, and difficulty.
While the objectives of PLANTHAB may be trivial to handle on more powerful or more specialized---and thus more expensive---hardware, the intent of the mission is to push the limits of low cost consumer level electronics~\cite{habcvpdd}.
